### Try It

Group Nom is live at [groupnom.com](https://groupnom.com). Grab some friends, start a session, and find your next favorite restaurant.

### What I Learned

AI dramatically accelerated my ability to ship. I handled product design, branding, development, and marketing as a solo builder. But the speed only matters if you're pointed in the right direction. Every decision still required critical thinking about user needs, system architecture, and business viability.

### What's Next

Continued improvements based on customer feedback. Finishing touches on the owned data system, then launching with a real marketing push. The product thinking, design work, and technical foundation are in place. Now it's about getting it in front of people.

### The Brand

Part of building a complete product is crafting an identity that feels cohesive. I developed Group Nom's brand system to match the app's personality: friendly, social, and a little bit hungry. The playful fork-and-spoon logomark, warm orange gradient palette, and bold typography all reinforce that vibe.

### The Problem

Every friend group knows the struggle: "Where should we eat?" turns into an endless back-and-forth of rejected suggestions, dietary constraints, and decision paralysis. Traditional solutions like group chats, polls, and taking turns rarely satisfy everyone and often lead to the same default choices.

I wanted to solve this problem in a way that felt fun rather than frustrating, and use it as a vehicle to explore what's possible when you combine AI-assisted development with solid product thinking.

### The Solution

**Group Nom** is a web app that helps groups discover restaurants together through collaborative swiping. The mechanics are simple and familiar:

- **Create a session** and share a 6-digit code with your group
- **Swipe together** on nearby restaurants (right for yes, left for no)
- **Match instantly** when everyone agrees on a spot

Early on, I leaned on the Google Places API to get to market quickly. It worked, but I learned it wouldn't scale: costs add up fast, and Google's terms prevent caching their data. I considered launching as a waitlist beta to control costs while gathering feedback.

That feedback changed my trajectory. Users requested features that simply weren't possible with third-party data constraints. It became clear: to build something truly differentiated, I needed to own my restaurant data. So I pivoted to building Group Nom's own data layer, which opens up unique features that weren't possible before.

No app download required. No sign-up friction. Just quick, collaborative decisions that end in everyone eating somewhere they actually want to go.

## The Vision

As someone passionate about both technology and creative expression, this project bridges two worlds. Rather than viewing AI as a replacement for human creativity, I'm exploring how AI can be a collaborator and tool to expand artistic possibilities.

The goal is to create an EP that explores:
- Building sounds from ideas and gathering sounds I find interesting
- Hybrid human-AI composition techniques
- Experimentation with emerging music technology
- The creative potential at the intersection of art and artificial intelligence
- Creating songs with ideas which should be shared

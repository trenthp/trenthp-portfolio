# Building an AI-Empowered Design Team

A strategic program to solve a high-visibility product crisis by integrating AI into our design workflow.

**My Role:** Director of UX Product Design (Lead Strategist & Prototyper)

**Core Outcome:** Resolved a CEO-level product issue, launched multiple highly-used new features, and cut our design/dev cycle time by 50% by building new AI-empowered capabilities for our design and dev teams.

## The Challenge: A C-Suite Level Crisis

An interest driven to do more with AI, I saw an opportunity when a high-visibility feature request was failing, creating a storm of complaints that went directly to the President and CEO of the company.

The problem was twofold:

**A Product Crisis:** We needed to ship a complex, high-quality, and nuanced feature fast to solve a major customer pain point.

**A Process Bottleneck:** Our existing design-to-dev workflow was slow, with basic handoffs and a design system that wasn't built for this level of complexity.

## The Opportunity: A Catalyst for Change

I saw this crisis as a catalyst. Instead of a one-off fix, I proposed we use this high-stakes feature as the pilot program for a new, AI-empowered workflow.

**My Hypothesis:** We could use Generative AI to solve this immediate crisis and simultaneously build a scalable, long-term system that would make all future development faster, better, and more efficient.

I pitched this vision to the VPs of Product and Engineering, and they agreed.

## My Role: From Director to "Product Producer"

This required me to be more than a traditional design director. I became a hands-on "Product Producer," strategically orchestrating the work from concept to code.

- **Evangelized the Vision** and secured buy-in for this new, experimental approach
- **Planned the End-to-End Workflow** and aligned with engineering on the tech stack
- **Acted as Lead Prototyper** on the pilot, using it for user testing and supplying code directly to the engineer to accelerate the first build
- **Led the Strategic Pivot** of our design system to TailwindCSS to support this new, scalable model
- **Mentored & Upskilled the Team**, transforming them into an AI-empowered design function

## The Process: A Phased Strategic Shift

I implemented this shift in three phases, moving from a single crisis to a new, permanent capability.

### Phase 1: The Pilot Project (The 0-to-1)

I worked 1-on-1 with an engineer to build the first critical feature.

**Matching the Stack:** To ensure a smooth handoff, I used Gemini to help generate production-ready code snippets that matched our existing tech stack.

**Solving the Crisis:** The handoff was basic, but the close collaboration worked. We launched the feature successfully, resolving the executive-level complaints and turning a major negative into a celebrated win.

### Phase 2: Building the System (The 1-to-N)

The pilot's success secured buy-in for a larger, systemic solution. We couldn't scale a 1-to-1 designer/developer model. We needed a system.

**Design System Pivot:** I led the decision to pivot our small design system to TailwindCSS. This was a strategic choice: it allowed us to build customization, accessibility, and AI-tooling directly into our foundations.

**Scaling Handoffs:** We secured our own Git repository to build out this new, augmented design system and a showcase for our high-fidelity prototypes. This professionalized our workflow and empowered developers.

### Phase 3: Empowering the Team (The "AI Factory")

My final goal was to make my entire team "AI-empowered." We built a program to scale the pilot's success.

**Standardized Prompts:** We built boilerplate prompt templates for consistent, high-quality UX copy, user testing scripts, and realistic mock data.

**Better Prototypes:** This new workflow allowed us to create high-fidelity, data-populated, and fully-coded prototypes—perfect for rapid, realistic user testing.

**New Tools:** I trained the team on using Git, understanding accessibility in code, and managing build deployments. This blurred the lines between design and front-end, making everyone more effective.

## The Results: From Crisis Solved to New Capability Built

This strategy successfully turned a C-suite-level crisis into one of our biggest success stories.

| Key Metric | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| **Product Launch** | Launched multiple major features that are now some of the most used and talked-about in the app |
| **Business Impact** | Resolved the high-visibility product issue, ending the stream of executive complaints |
| **Design Cycle Time** | Our new AI-powered workflow cut our concept-to-prototype time by 50% |
| **Team Capability** | Transformed the design function into an "AI-empowered team" that could build, test, and ship higher-quality work, faster |

## My Reflections

AI is a massive lever for design teams. This project proved that when designers get closer to the code—using tools like AI, Git, and CSS frameworks—we create incredible, undeniable value.

This experience solidifies my belief in a new, emerging role. It's less "Product Designer" and more "Product Producer"—a leader who strategically orchestrates the full stack of product creation, from ambiguous human problems to production-ready code, to deliver business-changing results.
